modify bldc_interface_uart.c and bldc_interface_uart.h for other platforms
	and can bus can be handled here
		actually modify comm_uart.c I read the blog post wrong
		leave bldc_interface_uart.c alone
	this is going to be a bit trickier than I thought
		everything was written with the assumption of microcontroller
		motor movement commands need to be called periodically 
		Method I want to do it is by using the periodic sending function of socketcan
			this api does not make that easy
			talon srx was easy because the can bus functions closely matched socketcan functions
				the sendmessage command included a period parameter
			Maybe use a loop in a higher level part of the code

	claims to have removed chibios dependency, doesn't seem complete
	only headers commentted out, makefile still uses stuff from chibios which is how I think the rest of the chibios stuff still compiles

bldc_interface_uart doesn't seem to be the place to change things
	it calls stuff from packet.c
	comm_uart.c is where the interaction with the uart hardware takes place
	bldc_interface_uart is initialized with a pointer to a function that handles the serial communication
